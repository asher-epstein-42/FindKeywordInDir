# Keyword Search Tool

This Python script is a simple command-line tool that allows you to search for a specific keyword within the content of text files (.txt) and Microsoft Word files (.docx) located within a specified directory. You can choose to either display the matching lines in the console or save them to a text file for later reference.


## Usage

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the script (`keyword_search.py`) is located.

4. Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python keyword_search.py <keyword> <directory_path> [-f]
```
- -f (optional): Include this flag to save matching lines to a text file. Omitting it will display matching lines in the console.
